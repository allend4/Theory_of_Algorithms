## Introduction
***
<p>The purpose of this assessment is to ensure that you have achieved the learning outcomes
of the module while also providing you with sample work to show prospective employers.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this project is to discuss two jupyter notebooks, <b>Post Correspondence Problem</b> and <b>Countdown Numbers Game</b>.</p>

### Post Correspondence Problem Notebook
- Definition and explanation of the Post Correspondence Problem.
- Definition and explanation of the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem.
- Python function to solve the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem.
- Explanation of what an undecidable problem is in computability theory.

### Countdown Numbers Game Notebook
- Overview and explanation of the Countdown Numbers Game.
- Discussion of the complexity of the Countdown Numbers Game.
- Python function, written in a functional programming style to solve a Countdown Numbers Game. 
- Explanation of the functional aspects of your code..

## Post Correspondence Problem Notebook + Countdown Numbers Game Notebook
You can view the notebooks in STATIC form at nbviewer and in DYNAMIC form at binder.
